# Web API Demo
A demo for web api session for Palestine Tech Meetups, August 5th, 2017.

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar install`.

If Composer is installed globally, run

```bash
composer install
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

## Configuration

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the `'Datasources'` and any other
configuration relevant for your application.

You can also copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the require details. You'll need to create a Facebook app and provide the required details.
